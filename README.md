## Examples of various Lambda function integrations with API Gateway and CORS enabled

Why? When working with Lambda functions, there are various different things to take into consideration.

- Is this function being invoked from an HTTP trigger?
- Is this function using API Gateway?
- Are you calling this function from a client-side applications?
- Are you running into CORS issues when fetching data from your Lambda function?

If you answered yes to these questions, then these copy-paste examples should help you to get up and running with many of the most popular runtimes.

Here are the supported runtimes that I will be creating examples for:
